## to-do

You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a `.promise()` function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. To learn more and make your queries asynchronous, refer to the [npm documentation on MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2).

* Application allows users to view the total utilized budget of a department&mdash;in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department (8 points).
